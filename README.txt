-- SUMMARY --

Alfresco module is an out of the box solution to integrate a Drupal site with
Alfresco Open Source Enterprise Content Management System (ECM). It consists of

  stored in Alfresco repository, caching of node properties, search repository,
  Views support, ... 

* alfresco_browser.module: Allows users to visualize, search, browse and
  retrieve nodes of the Alfresco repository.

* alfresco_field.module: Defines a CCK field type for creating and referencing
  an Alfresco node from another node.

  other Drupal content (similar to upload.module).
